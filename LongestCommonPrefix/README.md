# Intuition
The goal is to find the longest common prefix among a set of strings. The initial thought is to base the comparison on the shortest string since a common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string in the array. By starting with the shortest string and progressively narrowing it down with comparisons to other strings, we can efficiently find the common prefix.

# Approach
1. **Finding the Shortest String**: First, we identify the shortest string in the array. This string will serve as our reference prefix.
2. **Prefix Comparison**: For each string, we compare it to the current prefix. If the prefix doesnâ€™t match the beginning of the string, we shorten the prefix by removing its last character and try again.
3. **Early Exit Condition**: If at any point the prefix becomes empty, it indicates there is no common prefix, and we return `""`.
4. **Result**: After comparing with all strings, the remaining prefix will be the longest common prefix across the array.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: $$O(S)$$, where $$S$$ is the total number of characters in all strings combined. Each character is checked at most once across all strings, resulting in a linear pass through the characters.

- **Space Complexity**: $$O(1)$$, as we use only a constant amount of additional space (counters and indices). The prefix is modified in place without requiring extra memory.
